    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><b>Cinema Battle Cup — Introduction</b></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "This section presents a small, playful competition designed to demonstrate concepts from the Big Data Foundations course while working with a large-scale, multi-source movie dataset. The goal was to build a “World Cup–style” knockout tournament between well-known cinema characters — heroes and villains — using real metrics enriched from two different data sources: **MovieLens** and **IMDB**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the set of characters was manually selected by the user, all numerical attributes used in the competition were derived through data enrichment techniques applied to the movies in which these characters appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><b>Big Data Foundations Context: Data Preparation & Enrichment</b></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the competition, several steps aligned with the course methodology were performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Conversion of raw datasets to Parquet:**\n",
    "\n",
    "All MovieLens and IMDB datasets were transformed into Parquet files, taking advantage of:\n",
    " - columnar storage\n",
    " - efficient compression\n",
    " - faster analytical queries\n",
    " - better integration with DuckDB\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a core aspect of scalable data processing discussed in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Integration of MovieLens and IMDB via DuckDB:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using DuckDB, multiple views were created on top of the full IMDB dataset.\n",
    "However, to avoid unnecessary storage and processing, only the IMDB movies that had a valid correspondence to the original MovieLens dataset (via imdbId → tconst) were materialized into new tables/views.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensured that the enriched dataset remained:\n",
    " - compact\n",
    " - relevant\n",
    " - faster to query\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Data Enrichment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each character, the system aggregated information from both sources:\n",
    "\n",
    " - ml_ratings_count — number of ratings on MovieLens\n",
    " - imdb_ratings_count — number of ratings on IMDB\n",
    " - ml_average_rating — average rating on MovieLens\n",
    "- imdb_average_rating — average rating on IMDB\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics allowed us to compare characters based on the popularity and quality of the movies they appear in — a direct application of multi-source data enrichment.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><b>Competition Structure</b></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "The tournament is split into two groups:\n",
    "\n",
    " - df_characters_heroes — eight iconic heroes\n",
    " - df_characters_villains — eight famous villains\n",
    "\n",
    "Each group follows a knockout format until one champion remains.\n",
    "Finally, the two champions face each other in the grand final.\n",
    "\n",
    "**First Round — From Top 8 to Top 4**\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomised match-ups (using a fixed seed for reproducibility).\n",
    "Winner = character with the highest:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ml_ratings_count + imdb_ratings_count\n",
    "\n",
    "This favours characters appearing in highly viewed or popular films.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second Round — From Top 4 to Top 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "Winner = character with the highest weighted rating:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 0.5 × ml_average_rating + 0.5 × imdb_average_rating\n",
    "\n",
    "This rewards characters associated with well-rated films.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Third Round — Final of Each Category (Top 2 → Winner)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Winner = character with the strongest combined impact:\n",
    "\n",
    ">(ml_average_rating × ml_ratings_count) + (imdb_average_rating × imdb_ratings_count)\n",
    "\n",
    "This incorporates both rating volume and rating quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final — Hero Champion vs. Villain Champion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The winners of each category face off using the same metric as the third round.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><b>Reproducibility</b></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "The random shuffling of match-ups uses a fixed seed, ensuring the entire competition can be reproduced exactly.\n",
